## Save to Context Link

Save content from the current conversation to Context Link. One request, no fuss.

**Workflow:**

1. **Print this message:** `🔗 Saving memory to Context Link → {SLUG}` — Never print the actual Context Link URL, as it contains a private 'pin' or 'p' URL param.

2. **Pick the slug.** If the user said "save {name}", use that name as the slug (lowercased, dashed). If the user said "save this conversation", "save this chat", or similar without a specific topic name, use `chat-session-{YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM}` as the slug. Otherwise, infer a short descriptive slug from the topic. Only ask if truly ambiguous.

3. **Summarize the content.** Distill the conversation into a concise, reusable reference document in markdown. Focus on what's useful to retrieve later — strip conversational back-and-forth, keep decisions, specs, and key details.

4. **POST it.** Take the URL below and replace the path placeholder (`TOPIC_HERE` or `{SLUG}` — whichever is present) with the chosen slug (lowercase, use-dashes-for-spaces).

```bash
curl -s -X POST "~~context link url~~" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d 'Your markdown content here'
```

The body is raw text/markdown — not JSON. The server's LlmPoweredParser handles chunking and structuring internally. Just send clean markdown.

**Success response:** `{"message": "Saved", "namespace": "the-slug"}` with HTTP 201.

**Rules:**
- **Keep the body under 100KB.** If content is longer, summarize or condense it before sending. Do NOT split into multiple requests — distill into one concise document.
- If the user says "save X" — X is the slug. Always. No questions asked.
- Do NOT test the endpoint first. It works. Just POST.
- Do NOT verify by fetching it back. Trust the 201.
- Do NOT send multiple requests. One POST, done.
- Saving to the same slug creates a new version (latest wins on GET).
- After saving, confirm briefly: "Saved to Context Link as `the-slug`."
